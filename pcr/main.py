# main program!!
# beforehand: 
# fill beakers to 5 oz
# adjust arduino com in arduino IDE

# pseudocode in comments

# 1. CALIBRATE
# find focal length of camera

# LOOP THE FOLLOWING:

# 2. FIND APRIL TAG 0 AND 1
# function that takes in april tag ID

# 3. CALCULATE DISTANCE
# function that calculates distance between april tags

# 4. MOVE ARM TO APRIL TAG 1
# function that moves arm given set distance
# distance from arm to 0 is hard-coded

# 5. MAKE ARM GO DOWN [HARD-CODED MM]

# 6. CALL GET_LIQUID FROM HARDWARE

# 7. MAKE ARM GO UP [HARD-CODED MM]

# 8. FIND APRIL TAG 0 AND 2

# 9. CALCULATE DISTANCE

# 10. MOVE ARM TO APRIL TAG 2

# 11. MAKE ARM GO DOWN

# 12. CALL EJECT_LIQUID FROM HARDWARE

# 13. MAKE ARM GO UP
